# Pink Floyd Official Site: Milestone Project 

## Purpose

The purpose of the project is to build a front-end website for the band "Pink Floyd". The target audience for this website are current fans and any potential new fans. The site will be used to showcase their music and publicise their availablity to perform at events. The website content will contain the following:

* Photos of the band members
* Video clips
* Audio clips
* Links to their social media pages.


## Planning
The following outlines the planning undertaken for the project based on building a static website for a 1960’s rock band. I’ve chosen ‘Pink Floyd’ because of the wealth of material available and the diverse and interesting imagery used by the band. 


### Strategy Plane 

The business and customer objectives are defined within this section.

#### Business Objectives

* *Who are our target audience?*  Current and potential fans
* *What is compelling site visitors to come to the site?* The opportunity to see and hear music from the back catalogue and from the latest releases. Additionally, the opportunity to hire the band to perform at events.
* *Why is this site different from our competitors?* This is the ‘official’ band site therefore new material releases from the band will debut here first. Additionally, a hire request page allows fans to hire the band to perform at events and functions.
