# Pink Floyd Official Site 

## User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project


### Project Concept and planning

The following outlines the initial plan for the User Centric Frontend development Milestone project based on building a static website for a 1960’s rock band. I’ve chosen ‘Pink Floyd’ because of the wealth of material available and the diverse and interesting imagery used by the band. 
Conducted 15/6/2018.
#### Strategy Plane 

The business and customer objectives will be defined within this section.
